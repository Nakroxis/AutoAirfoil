# AutoAirfoil

Work in progress

AutoAirfoil is a data oriented wing designing application. It searches through all available airfoil-reynolds number combinations to design the optimal wing for the desired speed range and total aircraft weight. 

Main use case will be small-medium scale UAV/RC Airplane development.
